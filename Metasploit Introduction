Launch Metasploit by using msfconsole from the command line.

-- Main Components of Metasploit --

Auxiliary: Scanners, Crawlers, Fuzzers.

Encoders: Encode the exploit and payload, goal is of not being detected by target system.

Evasion: Similar to encoders where the goal is to avoid detection, but encoding is considered an indirect attempt
to avoid detection, where evasion is a direct attempt at this.

Exploits: Sorted by system, many of the names you would expect to see. Windows, Linux, Apple, Andriod, etc.

NOPs: No Operations, used as buffers to get consistent payload sizes.

Payloads:
Adapter - wraps a single payload into a different format. Example given would be wrapping a payload into a powershell adapter.
Singles - Self-containined payload, needs single action to be ran. Create user, launch an application, etc. No additional components needed.
Stagers - Smaller data sent to set up connection and futher payload transfer from Metasploit to target system.
Stages - Larger sized payloads. Will need to initially use a stager for a connection then transfer of these larger payloads.

Post: Contains post-exploitation tools

-- End Main Components of Metasploit --

Metasploit supports commands similar to Linux, such as ls, ping, clear, history.

Variables are cleared between uses of modules within Metasploit. Setting IP variables would need to be redone, for example when switching modules.

Typing use + module will change the prompt and begin allowing options for the selected module
Example: use exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue

When prompt changes, you can still use normal commands, such as ls.

Show options command can be used within a module to see it's specific options.
